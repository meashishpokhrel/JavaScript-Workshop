Variables

One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const, which can be used for variable declaration.

    1. var --> Scope is global. can be used anywhere in the program
                can be redeclared and update. 
    2. let --> scope in not global. only within the funtion
                can be updated only not redeclared
    3. const --> block scoped (within the fucniton like in let)
                cann't be update nor re declared
